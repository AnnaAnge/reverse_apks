> I was super bored to run 3 commands on terminal so i wrote a script to do it. :shit:

*Could be a Douglas Adams quote, but it's not. You're just in the 0 humour side of github! :shit:*

## How to use it?
```
chmod +x apk_reverse.sh
./apk_reverse.sh /path/to/your/file.apk
```

## What's the meaning of this?
If you want to reverse engineer for **ethical security testing reasons** an .apk file (which is the executable of an Android app) then you can use apktool and dex2jar. 

So this app does this for you or me :smiling_imp:.

## What do i need?

Well, you actually need a linx distro and the following tools downloaded and properly configured:
```
apktool
d2j (dex2jar)
jd-gui
```
